C99 allows to define a flexible array member as the last member of a struct

struct rec {
  void *addr;
  unsigned int nr;
};

struct recs {
  unsigned int count;
  struct rec rec_array[]; //= struct rec rec_array[0];
};

want to malloc N 'struct rec';
struct recs *recs = malloc(sizeof(struct recs) + N * sizeof(struct rec ));
